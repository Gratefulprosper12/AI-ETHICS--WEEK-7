# AI Future Directions: Edge AI Prototype

This repository contains an Edge AI prototype using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite, simulating recyclable item classification using a lightweight MobileNetV2 model.

## Contents

- `edge_ai_model.py`: Trains a MobileNetV2 classifier on the TF Flowers dataset
- `tflite_conversion.py`: Converts the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format
- `edge_ai_model.ipynb`: Full notebook version (Colab-compatible)

## Run in Google Colab

This notebook is compatible with Google Colab and includes model training, evaluation, and deployment simulation.

## Dataset

Uses the `tf_flowers` dataset from TensorFlow Datasets (can be swapped for your custom data).
