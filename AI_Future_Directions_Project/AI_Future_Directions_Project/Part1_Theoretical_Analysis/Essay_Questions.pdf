✅ Q1: Explain how Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI. Provide a real-world example (e.g., autonomous drones).
Answer:

Edge AI refers to deploying artificial intelligence models directly on local devices (the “edge” of the network), such as smartphones, IoT sensors, or drones, rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. This architecture significantly reduces latency because data doesn't need to travel over the internet to a remote data center for processing—it is processed on-site in real-time.

For example, in autonomous drones, edge AI allows the drone to identify obstacles, track objects, and make navigational decisions on the fly, without waiting for commands from a remote cloud server. This is critical for time-sensitive applications like search and rescue, where delays could result in mission failure or danger.

In terms of privacy, edge AI enhances security by keeping sensitive data (e.g., video feeds or location information) locally on the device. This minimizes exposure to potential breaches during data transmission and avoids storing personally identifiable information on third-party cloud servers.

✅ Q2: Compare Quantum AI and classical AI in solving optimization problems. What industries could benefit most from Quantum AI?
Answer:

Classical AI uses traditional computing architectures, relying on binary logic (0s and 1s) to train models and solve problems. While highly capable, classical AI struggles with combinatorially large optimization problems, where the number of possibilities grows exponentially.

Quantum AI, on the other hand, leverages quantum computing principles like superposition and entanglement. These allow quantum systems to explore multiple solutions simultaneously, making them exceptionally powerful for optimization tasks.

For example, a classical AI may take hours or days to find the optimal route for a delivery fleet across 50 cities, whereas Quantum AI could drastically reduce this time using quantum annealing.

Industries that could benefit the most:

Pharmaceuticals: Faster drug discovery and molecular simulation

Finance: Portfolio optimization, fraud detection

Logistics: Supply chain and route optimization

Energy: Smart grid optimization, energy distribution

✅ Q3: Discuss the societal impact of Human-AI collaboration in healthcare. How might it transform roles like radiologists or nurses?
Answer:

Human-AI collaboration in healthcare holds transformative potential. Rather than replacing professionals, AI is enhancing their capabilities by automating routine tasks and providing decision support.

For radiologists, AI-powered image recognition systems can pre-analyze scans to detect abnormalities like tumors or fractures with high accuracy. This reduces diagnostic workload and allows radiologists to focus more on nuanced cases and patient communication.

Nurses can benefit from AI-powered monitoring systems that alert them in real-time about patients’ vital sign anomalies, medication schedules, or potential health risks. AI chatbots can also triage patients or answer routine health questions, reducing administrative burden.

However, societal impacts include:

Upskilling needs: Professionals must learn to work with AI systems.

Ethical concerns: Bias in AI recommendations can affect care equity.

Trust & transparency: Patients need assurance that AI-driven decisions are explainable and accountable.
